# CCBloatware
SURE Adobe, I pay 60$ a month JUST to get your fabulous CC bloatware.

Update: It turns out CC installs around 32k files/directories (without any app) so it migth take a bit longer than I though.

I made the obsevation that Illustrator works fine without Adobe CC, of course you can't update it and you will need to install Adobe CC for new functions or security patches, plus it will ask for your Adobe credentials from time to time, no big deal. Photoshop on the other hand complains immediately at launch that it requieres CC, the goal here is to find a way around that and get rid of the dozens services installed, thousands of files and so on while being quite useless.
